#ArduBlock


ArduBlock is a Block Programming Language for Arduino. The language and functions model closely to [Arduino Language Reference](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)

##Users
Ardublock is a free graphical programming environment to make programming physical computing with Arduino as easy as drag and drop. It is based on the popular ‘scratch’ programming language, which many will already be familiar with.  Ardublock generates code in C, a text based language used by the Arduino IDE, which can then be studied and modified if desired. 

Ardublock is an extension to the Arduino IDE so that will need to be downloaded as well (found here https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).  
* Ardublock is tested with version 1.6.12, available here: https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.12-windows.exe

Code written in Ardublock has the file extension .abp.

####Getting Started with ArduBlock
1. Install the Arduino IDE, from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Download ardublock-all.jar from https://github.com/gregcorbett/ardublock/releases/latest
3. Copy ardublock-all.jar to C:/Users/<username>/Arduino/tools/ArduBlockTool/tool/ardublock-all.jar under
    * Be careful, the name of folder “ArduBlockTool” under tools folder is case sensitive. 
    * In Mac, /Users/<username>/Documents/Arduino/tools/ArduBlockTool/tool/ardublock-all.jar
    * In Linux, /home/<username>/sketchbook/tools/ArduBlockTool/tool/ardublock-all.jar
4. Start the Arduino IDE and find ArduBlock under the Tool menu

##Developers
If you wish to develop ardublock, follow the instructions below. A prerequsite is openblocks, which can be found here https://github.com/gregcorbett/openblocks/archive/v1.0.zip
###Installation

The project is managed by Maven. After checking out the source for the first time, one should run the following to install Arduino's pde.jar into the local repository. 

	$ mvn validate

###Usage

	$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ardublock.Main"

###Development

Change the /src/main/resources/com/ardublock/block/ardublock_def.xml to add new blocks to ArduBlock

	$ mvn clean package

	$ mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ardublock.Main"

The Visual Block environment should show up. Happy Hacking! ;) 

###Deploy

Edit code of ardublock

	$ mvn clean package

copy the target/ardublock-all.jar to Arduino\tools\ArduBlockTool\tool
